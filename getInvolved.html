  <center><h2>Impact Your Community</h2></center><hr>

    <p><h4>Mental health matters to everyone. Individuals, groups, organizations, and companies can make a difference by speaking out, raising awareness, and taking action against mental health issues. Try some of these actions today to impact your community!</h4></p>
    <p>1. Host a mental health screening event. Visit the Screening for Mental Health website to find out more!</p>
    <p>2. Talk about it. Ask people how they're doing and mean it! Always be ready to listen and encourage. </p>
    <p>3. Share your story. Have you personally struggled or currently struggle with mental illness? Don't hesitate to tell friends and family about it. Your story can encourage others to ask for help.</p>
    <p>4. Read about it. Educate yourself about mental illness and suicide. Learn about the signs and symptoms and where to receive help in your area.</p>
    <p>6. Volunteer with local mental health awareness organizations. </p>
    <p>7. Watch out for bullying at school or in the office. Bullying can lead to many difficulties including depression. Be aware of destructive behavior around you and report it to a trusted adult when necessary.</p>
    <p>8. Encourage friends and family to eat healthy for mental health. Good nutrition can make a difference in how we feel.</p>
    <p>9. Organize group workouts with friends to improve your mental health. Exercise is a great mood booster and is even more effective when you spend time with friends!</p>
    <p>10.Talk about mental health with your children. Donâ€™t assume kids are too young to understand. Depression can affect children in elementary school. </p>
